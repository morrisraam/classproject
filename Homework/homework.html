<p>Tucked away on the backside of a strip mall, Minato can easily be missed on busy Spring Road, but it?s been a Smyrna institution for nearly 30 years. Amongst the kitschy decor, the menu consists of classic sushi favorites and servers who make everyone feel like regulars. Order the off-menu cowboy hat; a rice cracker topped with crab salad and a fried scallop.
